# 🎭 PersonaSwap – Mood-based UI Skins for Websites

**PersonaSwap** is a fun and unique web app or Chrome extension that allows users to change the personality of a website’s UI in real-time based on a selected "mood" or "persona." Whether you want to give your site a dark and edgy look or turn it into something bubbly and motivational, PersonaSwap can do it!

## ✨ What It Is

PersonaSwap lets you toggle between different "personas" that dramatically alter the look and feel of a website. Each persona changes the site's UI, including colors, fonts, tooltips, buttons, and more, to reflect different moods.

Examples of personas include:

- **Goth Mode**: Dark themes with creepy tooltips ("This might break").
- **Cheerleader Mode**: Bubbly colors and motivational microcopy.
- **Grumpy Dev Mode**: Monospace fonts with passive-aggressive buttons ("Fine, Submit it").
